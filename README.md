# Search-Engine
This project implements a console-based document search engine in C++. It allows you to index and search through multiple text files using various query types. Two indexing strategies are implemented: unordered_map (hash map) and map (balanced tree map) to compare performance and behavior. 
# Technologies:
  1. C++
  2. Standard Template Library (<map>, <unordered_map>, <algorithm>, <vector>)
